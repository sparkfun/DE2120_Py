#
# This example demonstrates how to get the scanner connected and will output
# and barcode it sees.
# 
# NOTE: you must put the module into COM mode by scanning the PORVIC barcode 
# in the datasheet. This will put the module in the correct mode to receive 
# and transmit serial.
#
# This package has been developed on a Raspberry Pi 4. Connect the DE2120 Barcode
# Scanner Breakout directly to your Pi using a USB-C cable
